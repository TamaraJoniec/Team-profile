# Team Profile Generator

##  Task

My task is to take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I have been provided with tests, so make sure every part of my code passes each provided test.

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

    * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the **team manager**’s:
      * Name
      * Employee ID
      * Email address
      * Office number
    * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
      * Add an engineer
      * Add an intern 
      * Finish building the team
    * When a user selects the **engineer** option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
      * Engineer's Name
      * ID
      * Email
      * GitHub username
    * When a user selects the intern option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
      * Intern’s name
      * ID
      * Email
      * School
    * When a user decides to finish building their team then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
